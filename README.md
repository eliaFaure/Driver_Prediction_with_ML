The integration of advanced sensors and machine learning techniques transforms vehicle automation and safety.
This project focuses on distinguishing driving behaviors
to support applications such as fleet management and
safety monitoring. Data from nine scenarios across three
drivers and vehicles are processed using a two-phased
approach. The first phase involves feature transformation through a sliding window technique and feature
reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to
address high dimensionality. The second phase implements
and evaluates classification models, including Logistic
Regression, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines
(SVM), and XGBoost. Logistic Regression and SVM
deliver the best accuracy and generalization across unseen
data. The findings emphasize the significance of feature
engineering and evaluation strategies in improving driver
classification performance, highlighting the importance of
feature reduction and robust evaluation methods.
